## Portfolio project
After making "x" times another portfolio project, I decide to make it this time on github. 

## Motivation
Every web-developer need a portfolio webpage, so I could use it as a bussines card.

## Build status
This page is still in building process. Change comming in a few days.

## Code style
I didn't make code review for this one, so there is possibility for a little chaos in my code. (for now)

## Tech/framework used
HTML, CSS, JS.
